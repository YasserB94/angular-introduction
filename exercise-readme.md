## Friend-List

A basic webapp that shows a form where people can enter their information to add themselves to your friendlist

## Learning Objectives

- Use of the Angular CLI
- Improve your understanding of TypeScript
- Basic understanding of Angular
  - Components
  - Services
- Configure a NodeJS API
- Creation of an Angular form
- Communicate between a NodeJS server and an Angular APP

## Must Haves

- The Form fields:
  - First name - Text input
  - Last Name - Text input
  - Email - Text input
  - Phone number - Text input
  - Favourite Programming language - Selectable provided options
- Visual feedback on the user input.
- Form validation
- A representation of the friends
  - The exercise requires us to do this trough a GET request.
- A way to add the form's information to the friend list
  - The exercise requires us to do this trough a POST request.

## Nice To Haves:

- Form validation (again?)
  - Make sure the phone number is a real phone number
    - Here it's ok to be country specific.
- Seperate pages
  - One to add a friend
  - One to see the friendlist
- Best friend's list
- Some extra data fields.
- Custom getters.
  - Examples:
    - Only show the friends that like PHP
    - A list of people between age x and x
    - .... Go crazy

## My Roadmap to the end of this exercise:

### Have a basic understanding of angular

- All the knownledge I have/Find on angular will be posted in this repository's readme.md
- Currently still adding source links, but I want to get back to coding this project ASAP!
